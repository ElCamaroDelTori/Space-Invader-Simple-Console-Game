# Space-Invader-Simple-Console-Game

It works only on Windows as it uses conio.h and windows.h libraries.

This is a ultra-simplified console version of the Space Invader game made in C++ with around 200 lines of code.
Movement is done by using the W,S,A and D keys, in order to shoot press P.

This is not meant to be a "serious" project, use it as you will.
